This repository contains Macaulay2 code for selected examples and exercises from the textbook *"Power Sums, Gorenstein Algebras, and Determinantal Loci"* by Iarrobino and Kanev.

These materials are part of a reading course organized by Jaewoo Jung ([homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/jaewoojung)) and Maciej Gałazka ([homepage](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~mgalazka/)) at DGIST BRL-AGSTA (Basic Research Laboratory – *Algebra and Geometry of Spaces of Tensors, and Applications*).

You can run the code in the file `PowerSums_GorensteinAlgebras.m2` either locally using your Macaulay2 installation, or online via the Macaulay2 web interface:
